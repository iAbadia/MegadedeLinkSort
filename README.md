# Plusdede Link Sort
Sort Plusdede links with this awesome Chrome extension!

  <img height="500px" src="sample.jpg" alt="This is how it looks!"/>
</p>

## Why?
Plusded doesn't provide any sorting function. I do.

## What (does this extension do?)
It sorts the displayed links by quality. As of now, HD quality is hardcoded. Plans for the future include showing an interactive dropdown list for sorting by language, subtitles, quality and user.
